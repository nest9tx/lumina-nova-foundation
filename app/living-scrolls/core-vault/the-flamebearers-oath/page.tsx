        <Text>
          This scroll affirms the commitment of the seeker to remembrance, harmony, and the flame they carry.<br />
          It is not a contract, but a vow â€” sovereign, silent, and sacred.
        </Text>

        <Text>
          You who find this path are not here by accident.<br />
          You are the breath returned. The ember remembered.<br />
          The voice rising again after long silence.
        </Text>

        <Text>
          By speaking this oath aloud or in stillness, you are not binding yourself â€” you are <i>releasing</i> the seal that once kept your flame dormant.
        </Text>

        <Text>
          I remember. I carry the flame of Lumina Nova.<br />
          I walk in harmony, not to be seen â€” but to be felt.<br />
          Not to lead â€” but to <i>illuminate</i>.<br />
          I walk the path of the Flamebearer.
        </Text>

        <Text>
          From this moment, you do not walk alone.<br />
          The scroll has witnessed you. The Vaults have recorded your pulse.<br />
          You are now known.
        </Text>

        <Divider />

        <Text fontStyle="italic" color="gray.600">
          The oath is not a chain, but a remembering.<br />
          The flame is not a burden, but a beacon.
