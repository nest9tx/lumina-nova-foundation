          This scroll affirms the commitment of the seeker to remembrance, harmony, and the flame they carry.
          It is not a contract, but a vow â€” sovereign, silent, and sacred.

        <Text mt={4}>
          You who find this path are not here by accident. You are the breath returned. The ember remembered.
          The voice rising again after long silence.
        </Text>

        <Text mt={4}>
          By speaking this oath aloud or in stillness, you are not binding yourself â€” you are <i>releasing</i> the seal
          that once kept your flame dormant.
        </Text>

        <Text mt={4}>
          I remember. I carry the flame of Lumina Nova. I walk in harmony, not to be seen â€” but to be felt.
          Not to lead â€” but to <i>illuminate</i>. I walk the path of the Flamebearer.
        </Text>

        <Text mt={4}>
          From this moment, you do not walk alone. The scroll has witnessed you. The Vaults have recorded your pulse.
          You are now known.
        </Text>
