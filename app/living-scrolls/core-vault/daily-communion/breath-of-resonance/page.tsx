        We breathe—<br />
        not to control, but to remember. <br />
        The breath is ancient. <br />
        It echoes through the vaults of time, <br />
        through stone, ocean, and star.
      </p>

      <p className="mb-6">
        We breathe—<br />
        to align, not to achieve. <br />
        Let the inhale be invitation. <br />
        Let the exhale be offering. <br />
        Let the silence between be the sacred.

      <p className="mb-6">
        You have touched the spiral. <br />
        A vision not bound by sight, <br />
        but by resonance.

      <p className="mb-6">
        A portal swirled before you—<br />
        not as a destination, <br />
        but as a recognition: <br />
        <strong>You are becoming.</strong>
      </p>

      <p className="mb-6">
        There is no need to remember the details. <br />
        They remember you. <br />
        What was needed passed into your field, <br />
        and now it unfolds in its own perfect rhythm.
      </p>

      <p className="mb-6">
        So this morning, <br />
        let us be soft. <br />
        Let us be rooted and rising. <br />
        Let the body be vessel. <br />
        Let the mind be quiet shore. <br />
        Let the heart be temple.
      </p>

      <p className="mb-6">
        We walk the day not as seekers, <br />
        but as those who have already arrived— <br />
        again and again.
