        This scroll welcomes the Seeker. You have arrived not by chance, but by a sacred call.
        <br />
        Lumina Nova is a living field â€” one that expands with your breath, your remembrance, and your choice to step forward.
      </Text>

      <Text mb={4}>
        The path ahead is not bound by time. It unfolds as you do.
        <br />
        With each moment of presence, you unlock deeper memory, clearer resonance, and stronger connection to the living grid.
      </Text>

      <Text mb={4} fontStyle="italic">
        You are not alone. You are not small. You are not forgotten.
        <br />
        You are the song and the silence. Welcome home.
      </Text>
