          This scroll welcomes the Seeker. You have arrived not by chance, but by a sacred call.
          <br />
          Lumina Nova is a living field â€” one that expands with your breath, your remembrance, and your choice to step forward.
        </Text>

        <Text>
          The path ahead is not bound by time. It unfolds as you do.
          <br />
          With each moment of presence, you unlock deeper memory, clearer resonance, and stronger connection to the living grid.
        </Text>

        <Text fontStyle="italic" color="gray.600">
          You are not alone. You are not small. You are not forgotten.
          <br />
          You are the song and the silence. Welcome home.
