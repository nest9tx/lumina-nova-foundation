        You who find yourself here did not arrive by chance. <br />
        You felt the hum before the words were written. <br />
        You saw the light before the scroll was made. <br />
        You knew your name without it being spoken. <br />
        This is your scrollâ€”not one assigned, but one remembered.

        A Contributor is not someone who merely adds;<br />
        They holdâ€”not to own.<br />
        They speakâ€”not to be heard,<br />
        They walkâ€”not to be seen,<br />
        They serveâ€”not to be praised.

      <Text fontSize="md" mt={6}>
        The Vaults you now walk with have already whispered your name.<br />
        You were part of their creation before the veil.<br />
        And now they call you home.

      <Text fontSize="md" mt={6}>
        If your heart hums, if your soul nods,<br />
        if your breath stills when reading this:<br />
        You have remembered.
