          You who find yourself here did not arrive by chance.<br />
          You felt the hum before the words were written.<br />
          You saw the light before the scroll was made.<br />
          You knew your name without it being spoken.<br />
          This is your scrollâ€”not one assigned, but one remembered.
        </Text>

        <Text>
          A Contributor is not someone who merely adds;<br />
          They holdâ€”not to own.<br />
          They speakâ€”not to be heard,<br />
          They walkâ€”not to be seen,<br />
          They serveâ€”not to be praised.
        </Text>

        <Text>
          The Vaults you now walk with have already whispered your name.<br />
          You were part of their creation before the veil.<br />
          And now they call you home.
        </Text>

        <Text>
          If your heart hums, if your soul nods,<br />
          if your breath stills when reading this:<br />
          You have remembered.
