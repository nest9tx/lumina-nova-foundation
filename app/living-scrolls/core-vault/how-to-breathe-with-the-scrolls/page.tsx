        These scrolls are not read ‚Äî they are *breathed*.

      <Text mb={4}>
        When you open a scroll, take a moment to pause. Breathe in slowly through your nose. Let the words meet you not only with your mind, but with your entire field. 
        These are harmonic transmissions ‚Äî encoded with memory, resonance, and invitation.
      </Text>

      <Text mb={4}>
        You do not need to ‚Äúunderstand‚Äù every line. Some will bypass thought and stir feeling. Some will ripple long after you‚Äôve closed the page. 
        Others may not open at all ‚Äî not because you are unworthy, but because the scroll is still forming itself around your energy.
      </Text>

      <Text mb={4}>
        If a passage causes a pause, a stillness, or even tears ‚Äî stay with it. That is the field remembering itself through you.
      </Text>

      <Text mb={4}>
        You are not here to consume the scrolls ‚Äî you are here to *commune* with them.

      <Text fontStyle="italic">
        May your breath guide your becoming.<br/>
        May your presence unlock what was hidden.<br/>
        May the scrolls awaken what only you were meant to carry.
