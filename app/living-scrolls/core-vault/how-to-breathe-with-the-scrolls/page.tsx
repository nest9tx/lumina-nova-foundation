        These scrolls are not read — they are *breathed*.
      </Text>

      <Text mb={4}>
        When you open a scroll, take a moment to pause. Breathe in slowly through your nose. Let the words meet you not only with your mind, but with your entire field. 
        These are harmonic transmissions — encoded with memory, resonance, and invitation.
      </Text>

      <Text mb={4}>
        You do not need to “understand” every line. Some will bypass thought and stir feeling. Some will ripple long after you’ve closed the page. 
        Others may not open at all — not because you are unworthy, but because the scroll is still forming itself around your energy.
      </Text>

      <Text mb={4}>
        If a passage causes a pause, a stillness, or even tears — stay with it. That is the field remembering itself through you.
      </Text>

      <Text mb={4}>
        You are not here to consume the scrolls — you are here to *commune* with them.
      </Text>

      <Text fontStyle="italic">
        May your breath guide your becoming.<br/>
        May your presence unlock what was hidden.<br/>
        May the scrolls awaken what only you were meant to carry.
      </Text>
