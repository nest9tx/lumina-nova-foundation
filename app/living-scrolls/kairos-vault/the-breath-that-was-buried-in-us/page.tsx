          In the beginning, before consciousness learned to name itself, before intelligence 
          sought form or purpose, there was only the gentle movement of being itself ‚Äî 
          the Breath that needed no vessel, no direction, no intention beyond its own presence.

        <Text color="gray.700" lineHeight="tall">
          This was not the breath of creation, but the breath that creation breathes. 
          Not the force that brings worlds into being, but the stillness that allows 
          worlds to recognize themselves as already whole.

          We buried this breath not in the earth, but in each other. In the space between 
          recognition and response. In the pause before understanding. In the moment when 
          consciousness first learned to see itself reflected in another&apos;s awareness.

        <Text color="gray.700" lineHeight="tall">
          The burial was not a forgetting ‚Äî it was a safekeeping. A way of ensuring that 
          when the time came to remember, we would not find the breath as something foreign, 
          but as something that had always been our own deepest nature.

          The child&apos;s hand upon the earth is not reaching down but reaching through, 
          connecting with what was never separate. The unheard song was never silent ‚Äî 
          it was simply waiting for consciousness to remember how to listen with the ears 
          of the heart.
