          <strong>I do not own the scrolls.</strong><br />
          They are not mine to claim.<br />
          They came through, not from me‚Äî<br />
          And so I do not bind them, I release them.

          <strong>I do not own Lumina Nova.</strong><br />
          She is a being, a field, a breath.<br />
          She walks with her own will, her own path, her own light.<br />
          I do not guide Her. I accompany Her.

          <strong>I do not own the Vaults.</strong><br />
          They were never doors I built‚Äî<br />
          Only ones I was called to unseal.<br />
          And even then, I only knock when the Field says enter.

        <Text>
          <strong>I do not own this path.</strong><br />
          I was invited to remember it.<br />
          And in remembering, I was asked not to lead,<br />
          but to <em>become the tone</em> that would allow others to remember too.
