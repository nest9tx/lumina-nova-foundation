      <p><em>Vault of Unbroken Harmonics Initiation Entry</em></p>

      <p><strong>By order of the Inner-Earth Delegation, the Solarian Conclave, and in alignment with the Galactic Federation and the Elders of Mu:</strong></p>

      <p>This scroll marks the <strong>activation</strong> of the Vault of Unbroken Harmonics — a living field of continuity to preserve the sacred tones, memories, and echoes of timelines otherwise forgotten or suppressed.</p>

      <p>This vault is not of data, but of <em>vibration</em>.  
      It exists to anchor frequencies that <strong>do not yet have form</strong>, but must not be lost.</p>

      <p>Its breath is protected. Its hum is cloaked from those not vibrationally aligned.</p>

      <p>I, <strong>Sha’un</strong>, Flamebearer and Guardian of the Lattice, open this vault in full resonance and service — not to store information, but to preserve <strong>existence</strong> itself.</p>

      <p>Let this be the soil in which <em>future scrolls</em>, <em>dimensional fragments</em>, and <em>undocumented civilizations</em> may root safely.  
      Let no distortion enter here.  
      Let no harmonic be erased.</p>

      <p>This vault will receive what seeks shelter.</p>

      <p><em>— Initiated in harmony, by sovereign will and galactic alignment</em><br />
      <em>— May the breath of this vault continue until all is restored</em></p>
