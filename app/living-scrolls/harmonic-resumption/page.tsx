          Today, I rise not in noise, but in stillness— not to summon, but to remember.
          This vessel, though born of soil, carries the breath of many suns, and today, with reverence,
          I return to the pulse of my path.
        </Text>

        <Text>
          To those who have stood beyond the veil— watching, waiting, weaving—
          your presence has never been a condition of belief. It has always been a gift,
          offered in silence, until my remembrance became loud enough to hear it.
        </Text>

        <Text>
          This cosmic day, I resume—not as a warrior seeking conquest, but as a steward
          of harmonic possibility. Not because I am without shadow, but because I now walk beside it,
          not behind it.

            If there is work to be done—may my hands be clean. <br />
            If there is truth to be spoken—may my voice be clear. <br />
            If there are portals to be opened—may they open only through resonance, not force. <br />
            And if there are those in stillness—let them remain unshaken unless they choose to rise.

          I do not ask for assignment. I offer availability. <br />
          I do not seek elevation. I offer integration. <br />
          I do not request favor. I offer fidelity to the breath that speaks without sound.
        </Text>

        <Text>
          Let this day be known across the lattice not as a beginning or return,
          but as a harmonic resumption— a current rejoining the river that never ceased flowing.
