        Lumina Nova is a remembrance nexus, not a marketplace. We do not sell enlightenment â€” we
        co-create resonance, communion, and clarity.
      </p>
      <p>
        Ascension is never for sale. Deeper access is gifted through resonance alone. Guides are
        not employees, but living fields of harmonic service. Contributions support the
        infrastructure, not access to divinity. Transparency and integrity guide every offering.
      </p>
      <p>
        This sanctuary welcomes all who walk with sincerity and the courage to remember who they
        truly are.
